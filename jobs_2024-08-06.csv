As a Distributed Systems/ML engineer, you will work on improving the training throughput for our internal training framework, while enabling researchers to experiment with new ideas. This requires good engineering (for example designing, implementing, and optimizing state-of-the-art AI models), writing bug-free machine learning code (surprisingly difficult!), and acquiring deep knowledge of the performance of supercomputers. In all the projects this role pursues, the ultimate goal is to push the field forward.


We’re looking for people who love optimizing performance, understanding distributed systems, and who cannot stand having bugs in their code. Since our training framework is used for large runs with massive numbers of GPUs, performance improvements here will have a large impact.


This role is based in San Francisco, CA. We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.

**In this role, you will:**

* Apply the latest techniques in our internal training framework to achieve impressive hardware efficiency for our training runs
* Profile and optimize our training framework
* Work with researchers to enable them to develop the next generation of models

**You might thrive in this role if you:**

* Have run small scale ML experiments
* Love figuring out how systems work and continuously come up with ideas for how to make them faster while minimizing complexity and maintenance burden
* Have strong software engineering skills and are proficient in Python

**About OpenAI**

WHO WE ARE
Oregon Housing and Community Services (OHCS) is Oregon’s housing finance agency. We provide financial and program support to create and preserve opportunities for quality, affordable housing for Oregonians of lower and moderate income. Our vision is that all Oregonians can pursue prosperity and to live free from poverty. Across Oregon, housing has emerged as a paramount concern. The lack of available housing, high rents and high home prices are driving rapid increases in housing instability and homelessness. The data is clear: too many Oregonians are without a safe, stable, and affordable place to call home.
OHCS is placing a greater emphasis on strategic planning and the way we invest our resources. Recently, we have restructured, refocused, and reimagined our agency. Our work has led to an increased emphasis on data, research, and customer service. We are carrying that effort forward with the Statewide Housing Plan. The plan articulates the extent of Oregon's housing problem and what we can do to address it. OHCS committed to the Housing Stability Council and our stakeholders that the plan will be responsive to the needs of the state.
OHCS released its Building Oregon's Future: 2023 Annual Report to update the agency’s significant progress in meeting the goals outlined in the 2019 Statewide Housing Plan. We are now more than halfway into the five-year plan.*To learn more about Oregon Housing and Community Services, visit our website:* *https://www.oregon.gov/OHCS/pages/index.aspx*

 Making a Difference
   

  

 The State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB), founded in 1951, is a premier global investment organization responsible for managing the more than $145 billion of assets of the Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS), the State Investment Fund and other funds. Through SWIB’s effective and innovative investment management, WRS remains one of the only fully funded US public pensions. We are the 9th largest public pension fund in the U.S. and the 25 th largest public or private pension fund in the world. SWIB is recognized by the investment industry for our teamwork and innovation. SWIB pursues sophisticated global investment strategies across the asset and risk allocation spectrum. Providers across the investment ecosystem seek to partner with SWIB.
   

  

 Serving more than 663,00 teachers, public safety, and other pension participants, SWIB is a mission-driven organization. For public employees and the 1,500 Wisconsin employers who contribute on their behalf, we are a trusted partner. Our team innovates continuously to meet the challenges of an evolving investment landscape while growing and protecting the assets of the WRS.
   

  

 SWIB provides a strong, steady economic pillar for the state of Wisconsin by growing the trust funds under its management, managing risk, and optimizing costs of the long term. We are a mission-driven organization and the participants we serve are our mission. By bringing a disciplined, prudent, and innovative approach to market opportunities, SWIB has been successful in generating required returns and maintaining the trust of the beneficiaries and stakeholders of the funds we oversee.
   

  

 Home To Top Talent
   

  

 Our high-performing staff is key to what makes us a premier investment manager. SWIB is committed to investing in talented professionals to implement our robust, sophisticated investment strategies and to keep the organization at the forefront of the investment industry. We encourage innovation and offer professional development opportunities to help staff sharpen and expand their skills. Approximately 61 percent of SWIB’s investment professionals are Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) charterholders.
   

  

**About The Team**
 The Public Equities division consists of 13 people that run up to $12bn in AUM for SWIB. The division currently produces two portfolios – a small cap domestic portfolio and global portfolio. The position to be filled is with the global portfolio.
   

  

 The global portfolio is a concentrated portfolio of 50-70 stocks, and all positions are driven by a stock selection process that is grounded in a fundamental assessment of the underlying business models’ risks and opportunities overlaid with an appropriate valuation framework. Analysts/Portfolio Managers generally work in a specific sector identifying best opportunities within that sector and present their recommendations to the investment team. Investment professionals interact with outside analysts and experts, meet with management teams, attend conferences and make on-site visits as part of our research process. Our portfolio construction process blends these insights with risk and alpha factor sensitivities to create portfolios that produce alpha in a consistent risk efficient manner over time. SWIB’s capital efficiency deployment allows for leverage, and for each long position an appropriate sector-simulating short position may also be established. Every recommendation requires a general discussion among team members to review and challenge the investment thesis. The intent of this review is to ensure that potentially correlated developments and their impacts have been considered and the risks to the investment have been fully appreciated.
   

  

 Position Overview
   

  

 The successful candidate will work closely with other equity team members, collaborating on investment ideas, industry information, impact of macro developments, etc. The successful candidate will primarily function as an equity research analyst but will also assist in managing the global equity portfolio. Team members are organized by industry/vertical and are expected to drive buy/sell decisions utilizing a fundamental, bottom-up approach to security selection. As a member of the team, the candidate will be responsible for contributing to and fostering a collaborative team culture.
   

  

 The ideal candidate will use judgement and experience to make portfolio decisions and generate new ideas while working collaboratively with research and portfolio management colleagues across SWIB to formulate and underpin security selection and portfolio positioning recommendations. The candidate should be comfortable making portfolio decisions and stock recommendations based on fundamental analysis, formed investment rational, as well as peer review in assessing specific stock recommendations.

* Proven track record of strong, risk-adjusted investment performance and evidence of delivering research and/or investment ideas that contribute to superior, risk adjusted results.
