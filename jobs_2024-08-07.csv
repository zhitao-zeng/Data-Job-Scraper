On a day-to-day basis, you will be part of our multidisciplinary Scores team and priorities will be directed by our Product Manager for Scores.  

As part of the DNC Tech team, you will be collaborating with Product Managers, Engineers, Security and IT to build and deliver technology used by candidates and organizers in all 50 states and 3,413 counties across the United States to analyze data, organize campaigns, raise money, and get out the vote on election day.  

We are a fully remote, distributed team living in 19 states and from a variety of backgrounds. Some of us have worked in political campaigns, others in public sector tech, and others in industry. We value diversity in perspective, lived experience, and the many paths one may take into working in political technology. We believe deeply in the promise of breaking the boom-bust cycle of political tech work and building technology infrastructure that will support campaigns from cycle to cycle and will improve with every iteration.### **Who you are:**

+ We're focused on equipping Democratic candidates and campaigns around the country with the data and analytics resources they need to win, and are looking for a Data Scientist with a diverse range of experiences and skill sets to help us tackle numerous projects. Whether 2022 was your first time volunteering for a campaign or you've been working with electoral data teams for multiple cycles, we'd love to talk to you.
+ Good candidates are willing to get nerdy about the details while staying focused on our goal of electing Democrats. Among other things, in this role you could help us:
+ Audit and improve our existing data science products and pipelines. Help us continue building upon and improving our models, the pipelines that produce them, and other data science products we provide.
+ Build new predictive models for more efficient voter outreach. In cases where a new model is needed, help leverage our existing data and identify new data sources to create new and better predictions.
+ Collaborate with the Scores team to deliver results. Partner across functions to deliver timely and high quality data products to our users.
+ Promote tech team cultural values. Promote and embody an empathetic, kind, and collaborative workplace where people can do their best work to elect more Democrats. Encourage learning both within data science and cross-functionally, continuing to take advantage of our cross-functional team and fostering an environment of growth and curiosity.
+ Evaluate vendor-provided models for purchase. Where we do not have sufficient data to build models in-house, drive validation and evaluation of vendor models to meet user needs. Empower DNC tech team leadership with the technical understanding and context to make balanced build vs. buy decisions.
+ Improve and extend our internal record linkage tooling to build a fuller picture of voters. Help us maintain a premier voter file and help campaigns identify the impact of their programs through probabilistic matching.
+ Increase Fairness, Accountability and Transparency in Machine Learning. Ensure we are empowering users with the right training and documentation to leverage our data products to the greatest effect.
+ You will be part of the DNC's Data Team and will focus on both 1) the near-term results we need to drive for this election cycle and 2) the long-range development of groundbreaking products for the progressive ecosystem at large.
### **You might be right for this role if you:**

+ Have experience doing data science or statistics in a social sciences context, which may include electoral politics.
+ Advanced proficiency with R or Python and SQL.
+ 2+ years of experience with predictive modeling, record linkage methods, and/or experiment design, or educational equivalent.
+ Have strong written and verbal communication skills, and experience explaining technical concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences. You won’t just be building data science products, but you’ll be helping us ensure our diverse users trust them and know how to use them for their individual needs.
+ Are comfortable with building but also maintaining. We often need to move quickly and with agility to meet campaign deadlines, and sometimes you’ll need to leverage what’s been created already to get products to users when they need them most.
+ Are curious, collaborative, and humble – ready to work with a diverse, distributed team to solve interesting problems together.
+ Secure the future of our country? Right now a lot is at stake in our country and our team has a huge opportunity to make a real difference.
+ Work with amazing people? We’re building a diverse, distributed team, hiring the best people we can wherever they are—alumni from past Presidential campaigns working out of DC and New York, experienced product developers from the SF Bay Area, and more.
+ Never stop learning? There are people who know about politics and people who know about technology and a few who have figured out some things about how to combine the two, but we are blazing a lot of new trails and you should be comfortable exploring and learning from everyone you can.

**Life at Abridge** 




 At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.
 



  





 Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.
 



  





**Diversity & Inclusion** 




 Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

**Position Summary:** The Adams-Banks administration has outlined a bold vision to reimagine the educational experience for all New York City Public School (NYCPS) students so they graduate with real-world skills and experience, a head start on postsecondary, and a strong plan to put them on a path to a rewarding career and long-term economic security. Within the context of this vision, the Office of Student Pathways (Pathways), under the Chief of Student Pathways focuses on the alignment of school curriculum, instruction, and operations to ensure that all students graduate with real-world skills and experience, a head start on life after high school, and a strong plan to put them on a path to a rewarding career and long-term economic security.

Civilian Complaint Review Bd


Salary range: $84,981.00 – $103,548.00
**Job Description**
-------------------


The Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) is charged with investigating, mediating, and prosecuting complaints that members of the public file against New York City police officers alleging the use of force, abuse of authority, discourtesy, offensive language, untruthful statements made by officers, and racial profiling and biased policing. The Board consists of 15 members who are appointed by the Mayor, the City Council, and Public Advocate or designated by the police commissioner. The Board is responsible for governing the agency. The Executive Director is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the agency. As the largest police oversight agency in the United States, the CCRB currently investigates approximately 4,500 complaints each year.  

  

In April 2021, the New York City Council passed Local Law 47, which clarified that the CCRB has the authority, under its abuse of authority jurisdiction, to investigate civilian complaints against New York City police officers alleging racial profiling and other forms of biased policing based on race, ethnicity, color, national origin, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, immigration, or housing status.  

  

To execute this newly clarified authority, the CCRB has created a Racial Profiling and Bias-Based Policing (RPBP) Investigations Unit. The RPBP Unit has built a team of skilled and experienced investigators, investigating attorneys, and data analysts to handle these biased policing investigations, which are often complex. The RPBP Unit’s investigations include quantitative analyses of various NYPD and New York City datasets to identify potential patterns of biased conduct. To help support this work, the RPBP Unit seeks a full-time Data Analyst. Reporting to the Chief Data Scientist of the Unit, the Data Analyst will help to design and conduct these analyses and report their results in a clear, comprehensible way to agency staff and CCRB Board members.
  

  

The Data Analyst’s responsibilities may include, but will not be limited to:  

  

* Compiling and cleaning various NYPD and New York City datasets
* Analyzing officer-level, command-level, and department-wide NYPD datasets to identify potential patterns of biased police conduct
* Explaining analyses and presenting findings clearly to non-technical audiences in writing and orally
* Creating maps to aid investigations of civilian complaints
* Working with RPBP Unit staff to identify and request necessary data from the NYPD and other entities
* Reading and summarizing academic papers and/or government reports related to policing in New York City
* Assisting the Chief Data Scientist, Director, and Deputy Director of the RPBP Unit with the drafting and publication of reports on racial profiling and biased policing

**Overview**
 Come join a team of dedicated staff at an exceptional time in the Smithsonian's history as we prepare for the Smithsonian Campaign for Our Shared Future. This ambitious fundraising campaign's public phase will run from 2024 to 2026, culminating with the nation's 250th anniversary. It will expand the Smithsonian's reach and impact, empowering the institution to find solutions to today's most pressing challenges. The Smithsonian is also planning two exciting new museums. The National Museum of the American Latino and the Smithsonian American Women's History Museum share the experiences and perspectives of Latinos and women across history and deepen our shared understanding of what it means to be an American. The Smithsonian has built a model fundraising organization, driven by talented staff across our many museums, research centers and cultural centers. This position offers exciting opportunities for the successful candidate to make a significant impact on the future of the Smithsonian. There is no better time to join this amazing Institution.
   

  

 With the second largest collection of any Smithsonian Museum, this is a unique opportunity to help reimagine what a history museum can and should be today, and tomorrow to help us achieve our goal of greater reach, greater impact, and greater relevance. Through our collection, we can tell any story in American history. The United States Postal Service has issued more than 2,500 stamps since the first stamps appeared in 1847. The images represent some of our country's greatest achievements, its incredible natural beauty, as well as individual leaders, artists, authors and more. But we also recognize that not all-American stories have appeared on stamps. This strategic plan calls on us to do more in telling less known, though equally important, stories that deserve to be told to highlight the complex and complicated history of America.

Strong organizational, relationship, collaboration, and communication skills as well as the ability to work independently are essential. A minimum of two years of progressive major gift fundraising experience, a passion for learning and exploration, and the desire to join a dynamic and growing operation should be demonstrated in your application. Experience in complex higher education or a large cultural or environmental organization is preferred. Travel is required and work during the evenings and weekends may be necessary.
